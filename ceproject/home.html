        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p class="text">Tinker vs Des Moines is a case that took place from 1968 to 1969 having to do with the first amendment rights of students in public schools. In protest of the Vietnam War, a handful of students in Des Moines, Iowa chose to wear black armbands, and were suspended when they refused to remove them. There were a total of 4 students who were suspended and their case was subsequently brought to the Supreme court. They were represented by the ACLU and the case was argued by Dan Johnston. </p>

        <p class="text">The main defendants of this case were John F. Tinker (15), Christopher Eckhardt (16), Mary Beth Tinker (13). The two former students attended high schools and the latter attended middle school, all in Des Moines, Iowa. They had gotten together and discussed ahead of time that they would do this symbolic protest with the armbands, supported by their parents. The schools they attended heard of their plans and preemptively instituted a policy that forbade the wearing of the armbands. There was even a similar case a few years prior (Burnside v Byars, 1966) that determined that such actions can’t be banned unless it were to cause a “material disruption,” so the precedent had already been set that the law should favor the free speech rights of the students.</p>

        <h1>Decision</h1>
        
        <p class="text">Ultimately the supreme court decided that wearing the black armbands as a form of protest was protected by the first amendment because it didn’t cause any “material disruption” of school activities, as per the previous ruling Burnside v Byars. The decision was made 7 - 2, with 2 justices arguing that the schools’ administrations should have the right to prohibit certain forms of protected speech by their students.</p>
        
        <p class="text">There were two constitution amendments cited repeatedly in the hearing of this case. One is the first amendment which protects free speech and freedom of religion. The other is the fourteenth amendment which protects all citizens from the state enforcing any law that infringes on their protected rights. These two amendments were referenced as a defense as to why the schools should not be allowed to prohibit certain forms of speech by students while attending school.</p>
        
        <p class="text">The schools’ administrations had decided to create the preemptive ban on the armbands because they were worried about the potential disruption it would cause. They also seemed to want to avoid controversy arising from their students expressing opinions which were controversial in the public realm in general during that time. However, these concerns ended up being dismissed because the fear of disruption was decided to be insufficient to justify prohibition of the protected speech that these students were participating in.</p>

        <h1>Dissenting Opinions</h1>
        
        <p class="text">There were two dissenting voices on the court. The first, Justice Hugo Black, argued that the symbolic speech of wearing the armbands distracted from the education process, which is the sole purpose that students are in school. He stated that he does not believe that any individual has the right to air their opinion in any public space at any time they want. The other dissenting voice, Justice Marshall Harlan, gave the opinion that the school’s administration should be given the authority to decide whether certain demonstrations are disruptive to the educational process in order to keep those institutions operating smoothly. He argued that while freedom of opinion is absolute, there should be limits to freedom of conduct to ensure public safety.</p>
        
        <p class="text">The precedent that was set by this case that ruled in favor of the students’ right to free speech is often still cited to this day when students voice their opinions or take part in protest demonstrations in school.</p>
