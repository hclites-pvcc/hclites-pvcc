           <tr><td>operating system</td><td>software that controls the overall operation of a computer including file storage and retrieval, program execution, and environment for program execution</td></tr>
           <tr><td>job queue</td><td>a system of organization of jobs waiting for execution that are resolved in a FIFO fashion</td></tr>
           <tr><td>FIFO</td><td>acronym for "first in, first out" -- meaning the first to be added is the first to be removed</td></tr>
           <tr><td>interactive processing</td><td>a feature of newer operating systems that allows the user to interact with the pgoram through remote terminals</td></tr>
           <tr><td>time-sharing</td><td>a feature that allows multiple users to access service simultaneously</td></tr>
           <tr><td>multiprogramming</td><td>an example of how time-sharing is implemented where time is divided into intervals into which jobs are executed one at a time</td></tr>
           <tr><td>application software</td><td>programs that perform tasks related to the machine's utilization</td></tr>
           <tr><td>system software</td><td>completes tasks that are common to computer systems in general which build the infrastructure needed for application software</td></tr>
           <tr><td>utility software</td><td>one category of system software that extend the capabilities of the operating system by doing tasks that are not included in the operating system but are important for computer installations</td></tr>
           <tr><td>graphical user interface (GUI)</td><td>the visual representation of files, programs and other objects can be manipulated in a way that is intuitive to users, using pictoral elements such as icons</td></tr>
           <tr><td>shell</td><td>an older user interface that allowed users to communicate with the machine using text via a keyboard and messages displayed on the monitor</td></tr>
           <tr><td>kernel</td><td>the internal part of an operating system that contains software components that executre tha basis functions for computer installation</td></tr>
           <tr><td>device driver</td><td>software components that communicate with controllers and other peripheral devices to help execute tasks</td></tr>
           <tr><td>file manager</td><td>a unit of the kernel that coordinates the machine's storage by recording the location and contents of all the files in storage and facilitates user access to and manipulation of those files</td></tr>
           <tr><td>memory manager</td><td>a unit of the kernel that coordinates the machine's use of memory by allocating memory space as it is needed</td></tr>
           <tr><td>virtual memory</td><td>the large "fictional" memory space created by the memory manager shifting files around between around main memory and mass storage so that the memory is always present in the main memory</td></tr>
           <tr><td>boot strapping</td><td>also known as booting -- transfers the operating system from mass storage to main memory when the computer is turned on </td></tr>
           <tr><td>ROM</td><td>read-only memory -- a small portion of main memory which can be read but not changed and contains the computer's intitial program</td></tr>
           <tr><td>deadlock</td><td>a condition in which two or more processes can't be carried out because each one is waiting on the resources being used by the other</td></tr>
           <tr><td>spooling</td><td>holding data for output at a later but more convenient time, especially when elements required for execution are busy</td></tr>
           <tr><td>super user (or administrator)</td><td>a person who has privileged access to an operating system and the ability to change settings of the operating system and grant or retract privileges for other users of the operating system</td></tr>
           <tr><td>multi-factor authentication</td><td>the requirement of mltiple pieces of evidence of user authentication to access an account</td></tr>
